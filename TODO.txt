01/07/2012 - Easyjet + europython sprint.

[*] Split current http server into management and mock servers.
    [*] Move mocking logic to mock server, and simplify in boss server
    [*] Mock http server should talk to management server to retrieve responses
        for requests, and store history.
    [*] JSON data - b64 encode body
    [*] Encapsulate JSON-ified http request preset, request... in a class
    [*] Convert all communication to JSON instead of tricky HTTP headers
        [*] preset, mock
        [*] history
    [*] change 'rules' to 'rule' (http: 'METHOD URL')
[*] From management server, spin up mock http server on request.
    [*] Add view for spinning up an http mock server
    [*] Add client request on init to spin up mock server
    [*] Choose a port number that is not currently in use.
    [*] Destroy old mock servers
    [*] Give client ability to determine destroy timeout of mock server
    [*] Refactor out some non-view stuff into separate modules.
    [*] Move data variables to appropriate view modules.
[*] Refactor client/sub client class to share single http connection betweeen
    subclients rather than needing 2/3 per test.
[*] Convert prints to logs. Improve logging.
[*] Multi-client / multi-tenancy
    [*] Management server gives the client a unique id (UID) which should be included in
        the url given to it for use against the mock server.
    [*] Refactor storage in the management server to store by UID
[*] Keep track of started ports so as to save time when starting new mock
    servers
[*] Specifiy number of replies for a rule::

        mock.when('POST /someplace').reply("a first mock body",
                                           status=200,
                                           times=20)
    With a default of 1.
[ ] Refactor server startup
    [C] Spin up boss tool for test writers.
[ ] Update sphinx docs
    [C] Ensure they are up-to-date with latest code
    [C] Document usage example
    [C] Add an overview of how the internals (launching of servers) work
[ ] Add unit tests for helper classes?
[*] SMTP mock support
    [*] Refactor http/server.py out into a base mock server class.
    [*] Create a subclass of the base mock server class for use with SMTP.
    [*] Alter the way that mock servers are started so that asynccore doesn't
        block the main process.
    [*] Add documentation to all appropriate places.
------Version 1.0------
[ ] Support persistence
    [ ] Change dict ``HTTP_MOCK_SERVERS`` in boss/server.py to be obtainable
        at start up so that pids are not lost when the server is restarted
        (eg on save)
    [ ] Persist presets and history
[ ] Prepare support of non-HTTP protocols
    [ ] Refactor history storage and retrieval to be less dependent on HTTP
        calls.
    [ ] Return JSON that the client knows what to do with.
------Version 1.1------
[ ] SOAP mock support
--------------------------------------------------------------
Other future tasks:
[ ] Add static file serving for manual Ajax testing
