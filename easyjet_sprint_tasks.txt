[] Split current http server into management and mock servers.
[] From management server, spin up mock http server on request.
[] Mock http server should talk to management server to retrieve responses for
  requests, and store history.
[] Management server gives the client a unique id (UID) which should be included in
  the url given to it for use against the mock server.
[] Refactor storage in the management server to store by UID
[] Refactor history storage and retrieval to be less dependent on HTTP calls.
  Return JSON that the client knows what to do with.
