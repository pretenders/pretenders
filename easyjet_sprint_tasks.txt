01/07/2012 - Easyjet to europython sprint.

[ ] Split current http server into management and mock servers.
    [*] Move mocking logic to mock server, and simplify in boss server
    [*] Mock http server should talk to management server to retrieve responses for
        requests, and store history.
    [ ] Convert all communication to JSON instead of tricky HTTP headers
        [*] preset, mock
        [ ] history
    [*] JSON data - b64 encode body
    [ ] Encapsulate JSON-ified http request preset, request... in a class
    [ ] refactor history to use the JSON-ified data
    [ ] change 'rules' to 'rule' (http: 'METHOD URL')
[ ] From management server, spin up mock http server on request.
[ ] Management server gives the client a unique id (UID) which should be included in
    the url given to it for use against the mock server.
[ ] Refactor storage in the management server to store by UID
[ ] Refactor history storage and retrieval to be less dependent on HTTP calls.
[ ] Refactor client/sub client class to share single http connection betweeen
    subclients rather than needing 2/3 per test.
[ ] Return JSON that the client knows what to do with.


Change to flow of starting to test:
    - Client connects to Boss server.
    - Requests a mock server eg http mock
    - Server starts mock server and keeps track of it for closing later.
